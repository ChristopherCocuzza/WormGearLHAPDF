# WormGearLHAPDF

* To generate the LHAPDF files, use the command ```./genlhapdf -d results```
* The resulting files will be stored in ```results/data``` (they have already been generated)
* Use ```plot.py``` to generate the three plots below.  
* The resulting plots will be stored in ```results/gallery``` (they have already been generated)
* To learn how to load and use the distributions and widths, look at the functions within ```plot.py```
